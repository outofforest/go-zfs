# Go Wrapper for ZFS

Simple wrappers for ZFS command line tools.

This repository was initially created as a fork of [mistifyio/go-zfs](https://github.com/mistifyio/go-zfs). After a while I decided that I really don't like how that library was designed. I decided to redo almost everything, remove functionality I don't need and add missing parts I do.

To learn how to use the library look at the unit tests located in [./zfs_test.go](./zfs_test.go) and [./zpool_test.go](./zpool_test.go).
